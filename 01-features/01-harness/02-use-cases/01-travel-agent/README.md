## Overview

A complete travel guide agent that showcases all core harness features working together:
HTML generation, AgentCore memory for multi-turn conversations, the browser tool for live
web data, and combining Exa search with Code Interpreter for data visualization.

## Architecture

```
travel_agent.py
│
├── Part 1: create_harness (control plane)
│
├── Part 2: invoke_harness → HTML travel guide
│              └─ file_operations + shell tools (built-in)
│
├── Part 3: fetch HTML from microVM → save to local file
│
├── Part 4: create_memory → update_harness (attach memory)
│              └─ multi-turn: agent remembers user name + preferences
│
├── Part 5: invoke_harness (browser tool)
│              └─ agentcore_browser → live Amsterdam weather
│
└── Part 6: invoke_harness (MCP search) → invoke_harness (code_interpreter)
               ├─ remote_mcp (Exa) → tourism JSON data
               └─ agentcore_code_interpreter → matplotlib chart
```

## Sample Prompts

**Prompt (Part 2)**: "Recommend three fun things to do in NYC on a rainy day. Save as self-contained HTML with swipeable cards."
**Expected Behavior**: Agent creates `/tmp/travel.html` with dark theme, three activity cards, CSS/JS inline.

**Prompt (memory Turn 1)**: "My name is John Doe and I love electronic music — deep house, nu-disco."
**Expected Behavior**: Agent acknowledges and stores the preferences in memory.

**Prompt (memory Turn 2)**: "What's my name and what music do I like? Recommend a venue in Amsterdam."
**Expected Behavior**: Agent recalls name and music preference from memory, suggests a specific venue.

**Prompt (Browser)**: "Check the weather forecast for Amsterdam this week and save as an HTML weather card."
**Expected Behavior**: Agent browses a weather site, creates `/tmp/weather.html` with day cards showing temperature and conditions.

## observability

Every harness invocation automatically generates traces in CloudWatch via AgentCore observability.
The traces show each step of the agent loop: model calls, tool invocations, and timing details.

**Setup**: Enable [Transaction Search](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Transaction-Search-getting-started.html)
in CloudWatch (one-time, per account) to view agent traces in X-Ray.

```python
import boto3
xray = boto3.client("xray", region_name="us-west-2")
rules = xray.get_indexing_rules()
sampling = rules["IndexingRules"][0]["Rule"]["Probabilistic"]["DesiredSamplingPercentage"]
print(f"Transaction Search sampling: {sampling}%")
```

Navigate to **CloudWatch → X-Ray → Traces** to see the full agent loop breakdown for each invocation.

## Key Concepts

**memory provisioning**: memory takes 3-5 minutes to become `ACTIVE`. The script polls with a 10-second interval. Use `--skip-memory` to bypass this during quick testing.

**Same session, different tools**: Parts 6 uses two consecutive `invoke_harness` calls with the same `session_id`. The VM state (files) persists between calls, so the chart generator can read the JSON file from the search step.

**HTML output handling**: Instead of rendering in a notebook iframe, the script saves HTML files to `/tmp/` on your local machine. Open with `open /tmp/travel_guide.html` (macOS) or `xdg-open` (Linux).

**Browser tool limitations**: The browser tool browses real websites. Results depend on network accessibility and site availability at invocation time.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: memory creation fails with `ConflictException`
**Solution**: A memory named `TravelGuideMemory` already exists. The script handles this by listing and reusing it. If you want a fresh memory, delete the old one first.

### Issue: Part 4 takes too long
**Solution**: memory provisioning takes 3-5 minutes. Use `--skip-memory` to skip the memory demo entirely.

### Issue: Browser tool returns no data
**Solution**: The `agentcore_browser` tool requires internet access from the microVM. If your AWS account uses restricted VPC configurations, outbound browsing may be blocked.

## AgentCore CLI

Create and deploy a travel agent harness via the CLI (preview channel):

```bash
npm install -g @aws/agentcore@preview
agentcore create --name travelguideagent --model-provider bedrock
agentcore deploy
```

Add memory to your harness project:

```bash
agentcore add memory
agentcore deploy
```

Invoke with the CLI:

```bash
agentcore invoke --harness travelguideagent \
  --session-id "$(uuidgen)" \
  "Recommend three fun things to do in NYC on a rainy day."
```

Reuse the same `--session-id` to continue conversations with memory context.

## Clean Up

```python
# harness
control.delete_harness(harnessId=harness_id)

# memory (if created)
control.delete_memory(memoryId=memory_id)

# IAM role
from utils.iam import delete_harness_role
delete_harness_role()
```

## Running the Python Scripts

```bash
pip install -r ../../requirements.txt
```

```bash
# Full demo (includes 3-5 min memory wait)
python travel_agent.py

# Skip memory provisioning (faster)
python travel_agent.py --skip-memory

# Keep resources after demo
python travel_agent.py --skip-cleanup
```

To run the local chat server:
```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn sse-starlette
export HARNESS_ARN="arn:aws:bedrock-agentcore:REGION:ACCOUNT:harness/HARNESS_ID"
python travel_chat/server.py
# Open http://localhost:8000
```
