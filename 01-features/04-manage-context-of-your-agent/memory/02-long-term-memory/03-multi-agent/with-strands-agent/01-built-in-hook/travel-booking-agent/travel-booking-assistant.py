# # Strands Agents with AgentCore Memory (Long term memory via Tool)

# ## Introduction
#
# This notebook demonstrates how to implement a **multi-agent system with shared long-term memory** using AgentCore Memory and the Strands framework. We will explore how multiple specialized agents can work together while accessing a common long-term memory store with dedicated namespaces for each agent.

# You will learn:
#
# - How to set up a shared memory resource with a long-term memory strategy
# - Creating specialized agents with access to their own memory namespaces
# - Implementing a coordinator agent that delegates to specialized agents
# - Leveraging structured memory namespaces for agent specialization
#
# ## Scenario context
#
# In this example, we'll create a **Travel Planning System** with:
# 1. A Flight Booking Assistant with long-term memory of travel preferences and history
# 2. A Hotel Booking Assistant with long-term memory of accommodation preferences
# 3. A Travel Coordinator that orchestrates these specialized agents
#
# Each specialized agent will access its own namespace within a common memory store, enabling them to build persistent understanding of user preferences over time. This approach demonstrates how complex domains can be broken down into specialized agents that share a memory infrastructure but maintain their own areas of expertise.

# ## Architecture

#     <img src="architecture.png" width="65%" />
# </div>
#
# ## Prerequisites
#
# To execute this tutorial you will need:
# - Python 3.10+
# - AWS credentials with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Memory permissions
# - Amazon Bedrock AgentCore SDK
#
# Let's get started by setting up our environment and creating our shared long-term memory resource!

# ## Step 1: Environment set up
# Let's begin importing all the necessary libraries and defining the clients to make this notebook work.


# Run: pip install -qr requirements.txt


import logging
import time
from datetime import datetime
from strands.hooks import AfterInvocationEvent, HookProvider, HookRegistry

logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format="%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s",
    datefmt="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S",
)
logger = logging.getLogger("travel-assistant")


# Define the region with the appropiate permissions for Amazon Bedrock models and AgentCore


region = "us-west-2"  # Replace with your AWS region
MODEL_ID = "global.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0"


# ## Step 2: Creating Shared Memory Resource
# In this section, we'll create common long-term memory store with dedicated namespaces for each agent.


from bedrock_agentcore.memory import MemoryClient  # noqa: E402
from bedrock_agentcore.memory.constants import StrategyType  # noqa: E402

client = MemoryClient(region_name=region)
memory_name = "TravelBookingMemory"


print("Creating or retrieving Memory with Long-Term Strategy...")
memory = client.create_or_get_memory(
    name=memory_name,
    description="Travel Agent with Long-Term Memory",
    strategies=[
        {
            StrategyType.USER_PREFERENCE.value: {
                "name": "UserPreferences",
                "description": "Captures user preferences",
                "namespaces": ["travel/{actorId}/preferences/"],
            }
        }
    ],
    event_expiry_days=7,  # Short-term conversation expires after 7 days
)

memory_id = memory["id"]
print(f"✅ Memory ready: {memory_id}")


# ### Understanding Long-Term Memory Strategy
#
# The memory resource we're creating uses AgentCore Memory's long-term memory capabilities with a single user preference strategy:
#
# 1. **User Preference Memory Strategy**: Automatically extracts and consolidates user preferences mentioned in conversations
# 2. **Actor-based Namespaces**: Uses sub-namespaces per agent domain (flight/hotel) under the same user actorId
# 3. **Memory Persistence**: Unlike short-term memory that expires, extracted preferences persist beyond conversation expiry
#
# With the namespace pattern `travel/{actorId}/flight/preferences/ and travel/{actorId}/hotel/preferences/`, each specialized agent will have its own unique namespace based on its actor ID:
# - Flight agent will access: `travel/flight-user-TIMESTAMP/preferences/`
# - Hotel agent will access: `travel/hotel-user-TIMESTAMP/preferences/`
#
# This allows each agent to maintain its own specialized knowledge while using a common memory infrastructure.
#
# ### Setting Up Agent Identities


# actorId represents the USER identity - consistent across sessions for memory persistence
user_actor_id = "user-001"
session_id = f"travel-session-{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S')}"

# Both agents share the same namespace - semantic search differentiates flight vs hotel preferences
flight_actor_id = user_actor_id
hotel_actor_id = user_actor_id
flight_namespace = f"travel/{user_actor_id}/preferences/"
hotel_namespace = f"travel/{user_actor_id}/preferences/"


# Import the necessary components
from strands import Agent, tool  # noqa: E402
from strands_tools.agent_core_memory import AgentCoreMemoryToolProvider  # noqa: E402


# ### Step 3: Create Memory Hook Provider
#
# This step defines our custom `MemoryHookProvider` class that automates memory operations. Hooks are special functions that run at specific points in an agent's execution lifecycle. The memory hook we're creating serves one primary function:
#
# 1. **Save Memories**: Stores new conversations after the agent responds
#
# This creates a seamless memory experience without manual management.

# ### Creating Specialized Agents with Memory Access
#
# Next, we'll define system prompts for our specialized agents.


# System prompt for the hotel booking specialist

Provide clear information about availability, pricing, and booking procedures in a friendly, helpful manner.Keep the messages short, don't overwhelm the customer."""

Provide clear information about flight availability, pricing, schedules, and booking procedures in a friendly, helpful manner.Keep the messages short, don't overwhelm the customer."""


# ### Implementing Agent Tools
# Now we'll implement our specialized agents as tools that can be used by the coordinator agent:


@tool
def flight_booking_assistant(query: str) -> str:
    """
    Process and respond to flight booking queries.

    Args:
        query: A flight-related question about bookings, schedules, airlines, or travel policies

    Returns:
        Detailed flight information, booking options, or travel advice
    """

            session_id=session_id,  # Required
            region=region,
            namespace=flight_namespace,

# ### Creating the Coordinator Agent
#
# Finally, we'll create the main travel planning agent that coordinates between these specialized tools:


# System prompt for the coordinator agent
TRAVEL_AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """

- For flight-related queries (bookings, schedules, airlines, routes) → Use the flight_booking_assistant tool
- For hotel-related queries (accommodations, amenities, reservations) → Use the hotel_booking_assistant tool
- For complete travel packages → Use both tools as needed to provide comprehensive information
- For general travel advice or simple travel questions → Answer directly

Each agent will have its own memory in case the user asks about historic data.
When handling complex travel requests, coordinate information from both tools to create a cohesive travel plan.
Provide clear organization when presenting information from multiple sources. \
Keep the messages short, don't overwhelm the customer.

# ## Testing Memory Persistence
#
# To test if our memory system is working correctly, we'll create a new instance of the travel agent and see if it can access the previously stored information:

# Create a new instance of the travel agent

# ## Summary
#
# In this notebook, we've demonstrated:
#
# 1. How to create a shared memory resource for multiple agents
# 2. How to implement specialized agents as tools with memory access
# 3. How to coordinate between multiple agents while maintaining conversation context
# 4. How memory persists across different agent instances
#
# This multi-agent architecture with shared memory provides a powerful approach for building complex conversational AI systems that can handle specialized domains while maintaining a cohesive user experience.

# ## Clean up
# Let's delete the memory to clean up the resources used in this notebook.


# client.delete_memory_and_wait(
#        memory_id = memory_id,
#        max_wait = 300,
