# Long-term memory — multi-agent (Strands)

| Pattern | Folder | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Built-in hook** | [`01-built-in-hook/`](./01-built-in-hook/) | `travel-booking-agent/travel-booking-assistant.py` — multiple agents share a memory resource via the built-in hook |
| **Custom hook** | [`02-custom-hook/`](./02-custom-hook/) | `healthcare-assistant-using-episodic/healthcare-data-assistant.py` — per-agent memory scoping with episodic strategy |
