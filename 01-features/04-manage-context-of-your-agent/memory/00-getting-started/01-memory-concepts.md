# AgentCore Memory concepts

AgentCore Memory is built around a small set of primitives. Every tutorial in this repo assumes you know these six terms.

## The six primitives

| Term | What it is | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| **Memory resource** | The top-level container. Holds events, strategies, and extracted records. Has an ID, IAM execution role, optional CMK, event expiry. | Account / region |
| **Actor** | Who is producing events — typically a user, but can be an agent or any stable principal. An `actorId` is any string you choose. | Memory resource |
| **Session** | A bounded conversation or interaction. A `sessionId` groups events that share context (e.g., a single chat). | Actor |
| **Event** | A single turn written to short-term memory. Contains messages plus optional metadata and a `branchId`. The raw truth of what was said. | Session |
| **Strategy** | A rule for extracting long-term memory records from events. Built-in (Semantic, Summary, User Preference, Episodic), built-in with prompt overrides, or self-managed (your Lambdas). | Memory resource |
| **Memory record** | A structured fact, preference, summary, or episode produced by a strategy. Retrievable by semantic search. | Namespace |

## How they fit together

```
Memory resource
├── Events                 ← short-term memory (raw turns)
│   ├── Session A (Actor X)
│   │   ├── Event 1
│   │   ├── Event 2  ──── branchId "what-if" ──► Event 2a, 2b  (branching)
│   │   └── Event 3
│   └── Session B (Actor Y)
└── Memory records         ← long-term memory (extracted by strategies)
    ├── Namespace /users/X/semantic/...
    ├── Namespace /users/X/preferences/...
    └── Namespace /episodes/...
```

## Namespaces

A **namespace** organizes long-term records into a hierarchical path. Templates like `{actorId}`, `{sessionId}`, and `{strategyId}` expand at write time:

- `/users/{actorId}/facts` → `/users/user-42/facts`
- `/sessions/{sessionId}/summary` → `/sessions/sess-9/summary`

Namespaces are the primary axis for IAM scoping, tenant isolation, and targeted retrieval.

## Short-term vs long-term

| | Short-term | Long-term |
|---|---|---|
| Unit | Event | Memory record |
| Created by | You (`CreateEvent`) | A strategy (built-in or self-managed) |
| Organized by | Session + actor | Namespace |
| Retrieved via | `ListEvents`, `GetEvent`, `get_last_k_turns` | `RetrieveMemoryRecords` (semantic search), `ListMemoryRecords` |
| Typical retention | Days to a year (`event_expiry_days`) | As long as the memory resource lives |
