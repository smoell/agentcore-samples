# # Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Memory for Cross-Customer Analytics
#
# ## Overview
#
# This tutorial demonstrates how to use [AgentCore Memory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/memory.html) namespaces for cross-customer analytics. While Part 1 showed customer-facing personalisation (one customer at a time), this notebook flips the perspective — an admin/marketing agent queries across **all customers** to find patterns, measure funnel effectiveness, and recommend new products.
#
# ### Why This Matters
#
# Traditional analytics requires ETL pipelines, data warehouses, and pre-built dashboards. With AgentCore Memory namespaces, an agent can:
# - Query across all customers dynamically — no pre-aggregated tables needed
# - Reason across multiple data dimensions (spending, preferences, declines, life events)
# - Generate insights in natural language — no SQL or BI tool expertise required
# - Answer ad-hoc questions that weren't anticipated when the dashboard was built
#
#
# ### Tutorial Details
#
# | Information         | Details                                                    |
# |:--------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------|
# | Tutorial type       | Cross-Customer Analytics with Memory                       |
# | Feature             | Long-Term Memory Namespaces + Strands Agent                |
# | Key features        | Cross-Customer Queries, Funnel Analytics, Product Gap Analysis |
# | Example complexity  | Intermediate                                               |
# | SDK used            | boto3, bedrock-agentcore, strands-agents, strands-agents-tools |
#
# ### What You'll Learn
#
# 1. Query across all customers using broad namespace prefixes
# 2. Build a tool that iterates over known customers to aggregate data
# 3. Analyse recommendation funnels (pending → accepted → declined)
# 4. Identify product gaps from decline reasons and unmet preferences
# 5. Use `python_repl` for cross-customer statistical analysis
#
# ### Architecture
#
# ![Architecture](architecture.png)
#
# ### How It Works
#
# The admin agent uses the same namespace structure as Part 1, but queries differently:
#
# ```
# Part 1 (customer-facing):  /bank/customers/customer_001/preferences     → one customer
# Part 2 (admin analytics):  /bank/customers/{each_customer}/preferences  → aggregate all
# ```
#
# The agent iterates over known customers, pulls data from each, and reasons across the combined dataset.

# ## 0. Prerequisites
#
# To execute this tutorial you will need:
# * Python 3.10+
# * AWS credentials configured with access to AgentCore Memory and Amazon Bedrock
# * Amazon Bedrock model access (Claude Sonnet)
#
# First, let's install the required libraries:


# Run: pip install "boto3>=1.42.63" "bedrock-agentcore[strands-agents]" strands-agents strands-agents-tools pandas


# ### Setting Up Environment

from datetime import datetime
from bedrock_agentcore.memory.session import MemorySessionManager

# ## 1. Create Memory Instance and Populate Data
#
# This notebook is self-contained — it creates its own memory instance and populates it with sample data representing 3 customer profiles.

# ### Sample Data
#

# ## Summary
#
# ### What We Demonstrated
#
# 1. **Cross-customer querying** — The admin agent queries the same namespace structure as Part 1, but across all customers simultaneously
# 2. **Funnel analytics** — Measuring recommendation effectiveness (pending → accepted → declined) without pre-built dashboards
# 3. **Pattern detection** — Finding common decline reasons and underserved segments through LLM reasoning
# 4. **Product gap analysis** — Using preferences, declines, and spending data to recommend what to build next
# 5. **Dynamic code generation** — `python_repl` for statistical calculations the agent decides are needed
#
# ### Key Insight
#
# The same namespace structure that serves individual customers in Part 1 powers portfolio-level analytics here. No ETL, no schema changes, no new data pipelines — just a different query pattern and system prompt.
#
# By combining dynamic namespace selection (the agent decides what data to fetch) with dynamic code generation (the agent decides how to analyse it), you get ad-hoc analytics without the ETL pipelines, pre-built schemas, or fixed dashboards that traditional BI architectures require.

# ## 5. Cleanup
#
# Clean up the memory resource created in this tutorial:


try:
    memory_client.delete_memory_and_wait(memory_id=MEMORY_ID)
    print(f"✅ Deleted memory resource: {MEMORY_ID}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"⚠️ Cleanup error: {e}")
