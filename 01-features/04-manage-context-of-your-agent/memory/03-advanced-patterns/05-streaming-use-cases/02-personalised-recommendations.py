# # Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Memory for Personalised Recommendations
#
# ## Overview
#
# This tutorial demonstrates how to use [AgentCore Memory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/memory.html) namespaces to enable personalised customer experiences. You'll build an agent that dynamically queries across multiple namespace types — recommendations, transactions, preferences, and life events — and reasons across them to deliver contextual, personalised responses. Memory with namespaces gives agents native contextual data access for real-time personalisation
#
# ### Why Memory with Namespaces?
#
# You might ask: why use AgentCore Memory namespaces instead of a traditional database, RAG system, or key-value store like DynamoDB?
#
# **Namespace paths are agent-native:**
# - Hierarchical, semantic, and composable — `/bank/customers/{id}/recommendations/pending` is self-describing
# - Agents can dynamically construct paths from conversation context without SQL knowledge
# - No schema design, joins, connection pooling, or migrations required
#
# **Deterministic retrieval vs fuzzy search:**
# - Exact namespace match returns precisely what you need — no relevance scoring or semantic drift
# - RAG is great for unstructured knowledge, but business process data needs precision
#
# **Built-in actor isolation:**
# - Customer data is naturally partitioned by namespace path
# - No risk of cross-customer data leakage
#
# **Dynamic multi-source reasoning:**
# - The agent decides which namespaces to query and in what order based on the question
# - There's no fixed query plan — the LLM composes context from multiple namespace types
# - Adding a new data source (e.g., `/complaints`) requires zero schema changes — just write to it
#

# ### What You'll Learn
#
# 1. Create a memory instance and populate it with multiple data types (recommendations, transactions, preferences, life events)
# 2. Build a tool that dynamically queries any namespace based on agent reasoning
# 3. Pass customer context deterministically via agent state (not hardcoded)
# 4. Let the agent reason across multiple namespace types to answer complex questions
# 5. Use `python_repl` for dynamic calculations (e.g., comparing spending to card benefits)
#
# ### Architecture
#
# ![Architecture](architecture.png)
#
# ### How It Works
#
# The agent has access to multiple namespace types per customer:
#
# ```
# /bank/customers/{id}/recommendations/{stage}  → pending, shown, declined recommendations
# /bank/customers/{id}/transactions/summary     → monthly spending by category
# /bank/customers/{id}/preferences              → stated preferences from conversations
# /bank/customers/{id}/life_events              → detected life events (travel plans, etc.)
# ```
#
# When a customer asks "What card should I get?", the agent:
# 1. Queries `recommendations/pending` to see what's available
# 2. Queries `transactions/summary` to validate against actual spending
# 3. Queries `preferences` to check for conflicts (e.g., "no annual fees")
# 4. Uses `python_repl` to calculate potential savings
#
# This multi-namespace hierarchies and LLM reasoning allow the agent to answer complex queries by *dynamically* populating context according to each query.
#

# ## 0. Prerequisites
#
# To execute this tutorial you will need:
# * Python 3.10+
# * AWS credentials configured with access to AgentCore Memory and Amazon Bedrock
# * Amazon Bedrock model access (Claude Sonnet)
#
# First, let's install the required libraries:


# Run: pip install "boto3>=1.42.63" "bedrock-agentcore[strands-agents]" strands-agents strands-agents-tools


# ### Setting Up Environment
#
# Let's import the required libraries and configure our environment:


import json
import boto3
import time
import uuid
from datetime import datetime
from bedrock_agentcore.memory.session import MemorySessionManager
from bedrock_agentcore.memory.client import MemoryClient
from strands import Agent, tool
from strands.models.bedrock import BedrockModel
from strands_tools import python_repl

import os

os.environ["BYPASS_TOOL_CONSENT"] = "True"
os.environ["PYTHON_REPL_INTERACTIVE"] = "false"


# Configuration
REGION = "us-west-2"
MODEL_ID = "us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0"

# Initialize clients
agentcore_client = boto3.client("bedrock-agentcore", region_name=REGION)
memory_client = MemoryClient(region_name=REGION)

print(f"✅ Initialized clients for region: {REGION}")


# ## 1. Create Memory Instance
#
# We create a memory instance without strategies — we'll populate it externally with data from multiple sources rather than extracting from conversations.


unique_name = f"personalisation_demo_{uuid.uuid4().hex[:8]}"
memory = memory_client.create_memory_and_wait(
    name=unique_name,
    strategies=[],
    description="Demo memory for personalised credit card recommendations",
)

MEMORY_ID = memory["memoryId"]
print(f"✅ Created memory: {MEMORY_ID}")


# ## 2. Populate with Multi-Source Sample Data
#
# In production, this data would come from multiple systems:
# - **Recommendations** from your recommendation engine or CRM
# - **Transactions** from your core banking or card processing system
# - **Preferences** extracted from past conversations or explicit settings
# - **Life events** detected from transaction patterns or customer interactions
#
# The key insight: AgentCore Memory provides a unified namespace structure to incorporate all this *external data* into agent state. The agent can query any of these seamlessly without knowing the underlying source systems.

# ## 3. Define Agent Tools
#
# We create a single flexible tool that can query any namespace path. The agent decides:
# - Which namespace type to query (recommendations, transactions, preferences, life_events)
# - What sub-path to use (e.g., `recommendations/pending` vs `recommendations/declined`)
#
# This is fundamentally different from SQL — there's no fixed schema or query plan. The agent constructs the namespace path dynamically based on the conversation.

# ## 5. Multi-Namespace Reasoning Demo
#
# Now let's see the agent reason across multiple data sources. These queries require the agent to:

# 2. Cross-reference information from different sources
# 3. Generate code for calculations
#
# This is impossible with a single SQL query — the agent dynamically composes context.


# Customer 001: Frequent traveler, price-sensitive

print(f"🧑 Chatting as: {current_customer}\n")
print("=" * 60)

# Query 1: Requires cross-referencing recommendations with preferences

response = agent(
    "Why was I recommended the Travel Rewards Card instead of the Premium Platinum?",
    customer_id=current_customer,
)
print(f"\n💬 Response:\n{response}")


# ## 6. Switch Customer Context
#
# Each customer gets a fresh agent instance to avoid conversation history from previous customers bleeding into the context.


# Customer 003: Student, very price-sensitive

current_customer = "customer_003"
print(f"\n\U0001f9d1 Now chatting as: {current_customer}\n")

# Customer 002: High income, values premium
agent = create_agent()
current_customer = "customer_002"
print(f"\n\U0001f9d1 Now chatting as: {current_customer}\n")
print("=" * 60)

response = agent(
    "I travel a lot for business. What's your best premium card? I don't care about the fee if the benefits are worth it.",
    customer_id=current_customer,
)
print(f"\n\U0001f4ac Response:\n{response}")


# ## Summary
#
# ### What We Demonstrated
#
# 1. **Multi-namespace reasoning** — The agent queries recommendations, transactions, preferences, and life events, cross-referencing them to provide contextual answers
#
# 2. **Dynamic namespace selection** — The agent decides which namespaces to query based on the question (not a fixed query plan)
#
# 3. **Code generation for calculations** — The agent uses `python_repl` to calculate potential rewards based on actual spending data
#
# 4. **Deterministic customer context** — Customer ID flows through `invocation_state`, enabling easy context switching
#
# ### Why This Can't Be Done with SQL
#
# - **No fixed query plan** — The agent decides what to fetch based on the question
# - **Cross-source reasoning** — Joining recommendations with preferences with transactions requires LLM reasoning, not SQL joins
# - **Semantic namespace paths** — The agent understands `/preferences` vs `/life_events` from the path name
# - **Zero schema changes** — Adding `/complaints` tomorrow requires no migrations
#
# ### What This Enables
#
# - Real-time personalised experiences that adapt to each customer's full context
# - Natural language queries over multi-source business data
# - Easy integration of new data sources without schema redesign
# - Agent-native data access patterns

# ## 7. Cleanup (Optional)
#
# When you're done experimenting, clean up the resources created in this tutorial:


try:
    memory_client.delete_memory_and_wait(memory_id=MEMORY_ID)
    print(f"✅ Deleted memory resource: {MEMORY_ID}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"❌ Error deleting memory: {e}")
