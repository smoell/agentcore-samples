# # LlamaIndex with AgentCore Memory - Academic Research Assistant (Short-term Memory)
#
# ## Introduction
#
# This notebook demonstrates how to integrate Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Memory capabilities with LlamaIndex to create an Academic Research Assistant. We'll focus on **short-term memory** persistence within a single research session - allowing the assistant to remember papers, findings, and research context throughout a conversation.

#
# You'll learn to:
# - Create AgentCore Memory for research data persistence
# - Use LlamaIndex native memory integration
# - Build research-specific tools for paper analysis
# - Maintain research context within a single session
# - Test memory boundaries and session isolation
#
# ## Scenario Context
#
# In this example, we'll create an "Academic Research Assistant" that helps researchers track papers, findings, and research topics within a single research session. The assistant uses AgentCore Memory to maintain context about papers reviewed, key findings discovered, and research progress throughout the conversation.

# ## Step 2: AgentCore Memory Configuration
#
# Create or get the AgentCore Memory resource for our research assistant:

# ## Step 3: Research Tools Implementation
#
# Define specialized tools for academic research tasks:

    """Save a research paper summary with title, authors, and key findings"""

# ## Step 4: LlamaIndex Agent Implementation
#
# Create the research assistant agent with short-term memory context:


# Configuration for SHORT-TERM memory (single session)
MODEL_ID = "us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0"

# Create memory context for single session
context = AgentCoreMemoryContext(

# Create the research assistant agent

# ## Step 5: Testing Short-Term Memory Capabilities
#
# Let's test our research assistant's short-term memory through a comprehensive research session.

# ### Test 1: Session Initialization


# Initialize research session with detailed context

import asyncio  # noqa: E402


async def main():
    response = await research_agent.run(
        "I'm Dr. Sarah Smith from MIT's Computer Science Department, starting research on 'Machine Learning in Healthcare Applications'. "
        "Track this topic with status 'Literature Review'.",
        memory=agentcore_memory,
    )

    print("🎯 Session Initialization:")
    print(response)

    # ### Test 2: Adding Research Papers

    # Add first paper with detailed metrics
    response = await research_agent.run(
        "Save paper: 'Deep Learning for Medical Image Analysis' by Zhang et al. "
        "Key findings: CNNs achieve 95.2% accuracy in chest X-ray diagnosis, 12% improvement over radiologists, "
        "trained on 100,000 images with 0.03 false positive rate.",
        memory=agentcore_memory,
    )

    print("📄 Paper 1 Added:")
    print(response)

    # Add second paper with contrasting findings
    response = await research_agent.run(
        "Save paper: 'Transformers in Medical NLP' by Johnson et al. "
        "Key findings: BERT models achieve 89.1% F1-score in clinical note classification, "
        "struggle with rare diseases (<70% accuracy), excel at symptom extraction (94% precision).",

    # ### Test 3: Identity and Context Recall

    # Test identity and research context recall
    response = await research_agent.run(
        "What's my name, institution, and current research focus?",
        memory=agentcore_memory,
    )

    print("🧠 Identity Recall Test:")
    print(response)
    print("\n✅ Expected: Dr. Sarah Smith, MIT, Machine Learning in Healthcare")

    # ### Test 4: Detailed Metrics Recall

    # Test specific metric recall
    response = await research_agent.run(
        "What were the exact accuracy percentages mentioned in the papers I reviewed? "
        "Which authors wrote about CNNs vs Transformers?",

    print("📊 Detailed Metrics Recall:")
    print(response)
    print("\n✅ Expected: Zhang et al - CNNs 95.2%, Johnson et al - BERT 89.1%")

    # ### Test 5: Contextual Reasoning

    # Test contextual understanding and reasoning
    response = await research_agent.run(
        "Based on the papers I've reviewed, which approach would be better for analyzing "
        "chest X-rays vs clinical notes? Explain your reasoning.",
        memory=agentcore_memory,
    )

    print("🤔 Contextual Reasoning Test:")
    print(response)
    print(
        "\n✅ Expected: CNNs for X-rays (Zhang paper), Transformers for clinical notes (Johnson paper)"
    )

    # ### Test 6: Research Finding Synthesis

    # Add synthesized research finding
    response = await research_agent.run(
        "Based on Zhang's CNN results (95.2% accuracy) and Johnson's Transformer results (89.1% F1-score), "
        "I conclude that deep learning models consistently achieve >85% accuracy in healthcare tasks. "
        "This finding has high confidence. Save it.",
        memory=agentcore_memory,
    )

    print("🔬 Research Finding Synthesis:")
    print(response)

    # ### Test 7: Cross-Reference Capability

    # Test cross-referencing between findings and papers
    response = await research_agent.run(
        "How does my research finding about >85% accuracy relate to the specific results "
        "from Zhang and Johnson? What evidence supports this conclusion?",

    # ## Step 6: Testing Session Boundaries
    #
    # Let's test the boundaries of short-term memory by creating a different session:

    # Create a different session context
    new_session_context = AgentCoreMemoryContext(
        actor_id="academic-researcher",
        memory_id=memory_id,
        session_id="different-research-session",  # Different session ID
        namespace="/academic-research/",
    )

    new_session_memory = AgentCoreMemory(
        context=new_session_context, region_name=region
    )

    # Test memory isolation
    response = await research_agent.run(
        "What research have I been working on? What specific accuracy numbers did I find?",
        memory=new_session_memory,
    )

    print("🚧 Session Boundary Test (Different Session):")
    print(response)
    print(
        "\n✅ Expected: Limited or no recall from previous session (short-term memory boundary)"
    )

    # Return to original session to verify persistence
    response = await research_agent.run(
        "Now back in my original session - what were the accuracy numbers from Zhang and Johnson again?",
        memory=agentcore_memory,  # Original session memory
    )

    print("🔄 Original Session Return:")
    print(response)
    print("\n✅ Expected: Full recall of Zhang 95.2%, Johnson 89.1%")

    # Run all validation tests

    # Test 1: Memory recall - can the agent recall what was discussed?
    response1 = await research_agent.run(
        "What have we discussed so far in this session?", memory=agentcore_memory
    )
    print(f"🧠 Memory Recall Test response length: {len(str(response1))} chars")
    print(str(response1))

    # Test 2: Session memory - does the agent maintain context?
    response2 = await research_agent.run(
        "What did we talk about earlier?", memory=agentcore_memory
    )
    print(f"💾 Session Memory Test response length: {len(str(response2))} chars")
    print(str(response2))

    # Test 3: Cross-reference capability - can it connect to previous context?
    response3 = await research_agent.run(
        "How does this relate to what we discussed before?", memory=agentcore_memory
    )
    print(f"🔗 Cross-Reference Test response length: {len(str(response3))} chars")
    print(str(response3))

    # ## Clean Up
    #
    # Let's delete the memory to clean up the resources used in this notebook:

    # ## Summary
    #
    # You've seen how `AgentCoreMemoryContext` gives a LlamaIndex `FunctionAgent` session-scoped memory: papers and findings added during a session are recalled, cross-referenced, and synthesized; a fresh `session_id` isolates the context.
    #
    # For cross-session persistence, add a strategy (e.g. `SemanticStrategy`) — see the [long-term counterpart](../../../02-long-term-memory/02-single-agent/with-llamaindex-agent/03-memory-tool/academic-research-assistant-long-term-memory-tutorial.ipynb).
