# # Strands multi-agent System with parallel execution using AgentCore Memory Branching

# ## Introduction
#
# This notebook demonstrates **AgentCore Memory Branching** - a powerful capability that enables multiple specialized agents to maintain isolated memory contexts while sharing a common memory resource. This is essential for multi-agent systems, especially those using parallel execution patterns like Strands Agent Graphs.
#
# ## Why Memory Branching Matters
#
# In multi-agent systems, different agents often need to:
# - **Maintain separate conversation contexts** - Each agent focuses on its domain without interference
# - **Execute in parallel** - Multiple agents can work simultaneously without memory conflicts
# - **Share a common session** - All agents contribute to the same user session while keeping their contexts isolated
# - **Access relevant history** - Agents can retrieve their own past interactions without mixing contexts
#
# AgentCore Memory Branching solves these challenges by allowing multiple conversation branches within a single memory session, similar to Git branches for code.

#
# What you will learn:
#
# - How to create and manage memory branches for different agents
# - Implementing isolated memory contexts in a multi-agent architecture
# - Building agent graphs with Strands that support parallel execution
# - How branching enables safe concurrent memory access
# - Viewing and inspecting branch-specific conversation history
#
# ### Scenario context
#
# We'll build a **Travel Planning System** with three agents, each with its own memory branch:
# 1. **Travel Coordinator** (main branch) - Orchestrates the overall travel planning
# 2. **Flight Booking Assistant** (flight_agent_memory branch) - Handles air travel queries
# 3. **Hotel Booking Assistant** (hotel_agent_memory branch) - Manages accommodation requests
#
# The coordinator can delegate to specialized agents that execute in parallel, with each maintaining its own conversation history through memory branching.

#
# ## Prerequisites
# - Python 3.10+
# - AWS account with appropriate permissions
# - AWS IAM role with appropriate permissions for AgentCore Memory
# - Access to Amazon Bedrock models
#
# Let's get started by setting up our environment and creating our shared memory resource with branching support!

# ## Step 1: Environment set up
# Let's begin importing all the necessary libraries and defining the clients to make this notebook work.


# Run: pip install -qr requirements.txt

# ## Step 2: Creating Shared Memory with Branching Support
#
# We'll create a single memory resource that will support multiple branches - one for each agent. This shared memory resource acts as the foundation, while branches provide isolated contexts for each agent's conversations.
#
# Think of it like a Git repository: one repository (memory resource) with multiple branches (agent contexts).

# ### Understanding Memory Branching for Multi-Agent Systems
#
# The memory resource we've created supports **branching** - a critical feature for multi-agent architectures. Here's how it works:
#
# **Single Memory Resource, Multiple Branches:**
# - All agents share the same `memory_id` and `session_id`
# - Each agent gets its own `branch_name` for isolated context
#
# **Key Benefits for Multi-Agent Systems:**
#
# 1. **Context Isolation**: Each agent maintains its own conversation history without interference
#    - Flight agent only sees flight-related conversations
#    - Hotel agent only sees hotel-related conversations
#    - Coordinator sees the main orchestration flow
#
# 2. **Parallel Execution Safety**: Multiple agents can execute simultaneously
#    - No memory conflicts when agents run in parallel
#    - Each branch is independently accessible
#    - Critical for Strands Agent Graphs that support concurrent execution
#
# 3. **Clear Audit Trail**: Each agent's interactions are traceable
#    - Inspect what each agent discussed
#    - Debug agent-specific issues
#    - Understand the flow of multi-agent conversations

# ## Step 3: Create Memory Hook Provider with Branch Support
#
# The `ShortTermMemoryHook` class implements branch-aware memory management. This is the key component that enables memory branching in our multi-agent system.
#
# **Key Features:**
#
# 1. **Branch Initialization**: Automatically creates branches for each agent
#    - Main branch for the coordinator agent
#    - Specialized branches (e.g., `flight_agent_memory`, `hotel_agent_memory`) for sub-agents
#    - Branches are forked from the main conversation timeline
#
# 2. **Branch-Specific Memory Retrieval**: Each agent loads only its own context
#    - `on_agent_initialized()` fetches conversation history from the agent's branch
#    - Prevents context pollution between agents
#    - Enables agents to maintain focused, domain-specific conversations
#
# 3. **Branch-Specific Memory Storage**: Conversations are saved to the correct branch
#    - `on_message_added()` stores messages in the agent's designated branch
#    - Supports concurrent writes from parallel agent execution
#    - No race conditions or memory conflicts
#
# This hook provider is what makes parallel agent execution safe and efficient with AgentCore Memory.

# ## Step 4: Create Multi-Agent Architecture with Strands Agent Graph
#
# Now we'll build our multi-agent system using **Strands Agent Graph** - a framework that supports parallel agent execution. Each agent will be configured with its own memory branch, enabling safe concurrent operation.
#
# **Architecture Overview:**
# - **Coordinator Agent** → Uses `main` branch
# - **Flight Agent** → Uses `flight_agent_memory` branch
# - **Hotel Agent** → Uses `hotel_agent_memory` branch
#
# All agents share the same `session_id` but maintain isolated conversation contexts through branching.


# Import the necessary components
from strands import Agent  # noqa: E402


# Create unique actor IDs for each specialized agent but share the session ID
actor_id = f"travel-user-{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S')}"
session_id = f"travel-session-{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S')}"
namespace = f"travel/{actor_id}/preferences/"


# ### Creating Specialized Agents with Branch-Specific Memory
#
# We'll define system prompts for our specialized agents. Each agent will be configured with its own memory branch, ensuring conversation isolation and enabling parallel execution.


# System prompt for the hotel booking specialist
HOTEL_BOOKING_PROMPT = """You are a hotel booking assistant. Help customers find hotels, make reservations, and answer questions about accommodations and amenities. 
Provide clear information about availability, pricing, and booking procedures in a friendly, helpful manner."""

# System prompt for the flight booking specialist
FLIGHT_BOOKING_PROMPT = """You are a flight booking assistant. Help customers find flights, make reservations, and answer questions about airlines, routes, and travel policies. 
Provide clear information about flight availability, pricing, schedules, and booking procedures in a friendly, helpful manner."""


flight_memory_hooks = None
hotel_memory_hooks = None


# ### Implementing Agents with Memory Branching
#
# Each specialized agent is configured with:
# - A unique `branch_name` for isolated memory context
# - The same `memory_id` and `session_id` for shared session management
# - A `ShortTermMemoryHook` that handles branch-specific operations
#
# **Key Implementation Details:**
# - `flight_booking_agent()` uses branch: `flight_agent_memory`
# - `hotel_booking_agent()` uses branch: `hotel_agent_memory`

# ### Creating the Coordinator Agent
#
# The coordinator agent uses the `main` branch (default) and orchestrates the specialized agents. It can delegate tasks to flight and hotel agents, which may execute in parallel when using the Strands Agent Graph.


# System prompt for the coordinator agent
TRAVEL_AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are a comprehensive travel planning assistant that coordinates between specialized tools:
- For flight-related queries (bookings, schedules, airlines, routes) → Use the flight_booking_agent
- For hotel-related queries (accommodations, amenities, reservations) → Use the hotel_booking_agent
- For complete travel packages → Use both tools as needed to provide comprehensive information
- For general travel advice or simple travel questions → Answer directly

Each agent will have its own memory in case the user asks about historic data.
When handling complex travel requests, coordinate information from both tools to create a cohesive travel plan.
Provide clear organization when presenting information from multiple sources. \
Ask max two questions per turn. Keep the messages short, don't overwhelm the customer.

# ### Building the Agent Graph with Parallel Execution Support
#
# Now we'll assemble our agents into a **Strands Agent Graph**. This graph structure enables:
#
# **Parallel Execution:**
# - When the coordinator needs both flight and hotel information, both agents can execute simultaneously
# - Memory branching prevents conflicts during concurrent execution
# - Each agent reads/writes to its own branch independently
#
# **Memory Branch Mapping:**
# ```
# Session: travel-session-xxx
# ├── main branch              → Travel Coordinator
# ├── flight_agent_memory      → Flight Booking Agent
# └── hotel_agent_memory       → Hotel Booking Agent
# ```
#
# **Why This Matters:**
# - Without branching, parallel agents would overwrite each other's memory
# - With branching, each agent maintains its own conversation thread
# - The coordinator can safely delegate to multiple agents at once

# Build the Strands Agent Graph
# This graph structure enables parallel execution of specialized agents
# Memory branching ensures safe concurrent access without conflicts
builder = GraphBuilder()

# Add nodes - each agent with its own memory branch
builder.add_node(travel_booking_agent(), "travel_agent")  # Uses 'main' branch

builder.add_node(
    hotel_booking_agent(), "hotel_booking_agent"

# Add edges - define which agents the coordinator can delegate to
# The graph can execute flight and hotel agents in parallel when both are needed
builder.add_edge("travel_agent", "flight_booking_agent")
builder.add_edge("travel_agent", "hotel_booking_agent")

# Set entry point - the coordinator agent receives user input first

# Configure execution limits for safety
builder.set_execution_timeout(600)  # 10 minute timeout

# Build the graph - ready for parallel execution with isolated memory contexts
graph = builder.build()


# ### Multi-Agent System with Memory Branching is Ready!
#
# Our agent graph is now configured with:
# - ✅ Three agents with isolated memory branches
# - ✅ Parallel execution capability through Strands Agent Graph
# - ✅ Safe concurrent memory access via AgentCore Memory Branching
# - ✅ Automatic branch creation and management
#
# ## Testing the Multi-Agent System
#
# Let's test with a travel planning scenario that will trigger multiple agents:


response = graph(
    "Hello, I would like to book a trip from LA to Madrid. From July 1 to August 2."
)


# ## Inspecting Memory Branches
#
# One of the key advantages of AgentCore Memory Branching is the ability to inspect each agent's conversation history independently. This is crucial for:
#
# **Debugging Multi-Agent Systems:**
# - See exactly what each agent discussed
# - Identify which agent handled which part of the conversation
# - Trace the flow of information through the system
#
# **Understanding Parallel Execution:**
# - Verify that agents maintained separate contexts
# - Confirm no memory conflicts occurred during concurrent execution
# - Audit the timeline of agent interactions
#
# Let's explore the branches that were created during our conversation:


print("\n=== Viewing Memory Branches ===")

if flight_memory_hooks or hotel_memory_hooks:
    # Get any memory session to list branches (they all point to the same session)
    hook = flight_memory_hooks if flight_memory_hooks else hotel_memory_hooks
    if hook:
        memory_session = hook.get_session(actor_id, session_id)

        print("  • 'flight_agent_memory' = Flight assistant conversations")
        print("  • 'hotel_agent_memory' = Hotel assistant conversations")


# ### Accessing Branch-Specific Conversation History

# Now let's dive deeper and examine the actual conversations stored in each branch. This demonstrates how memory branching provides complete isolation between agents while maintaining a shared session.

# ## Summary
#
# In this notebook, we've demonstrated **AgentCore Memory Branching** - a critical capability for building robust multi-agent systems with parallel execution:
#
# ### Key Takeaways:
#
# 1. **Memory Branching Enables Parallel Execution**
#    - Multiple agents can execute simultaneously without memory conflicts
#    - Each agent maintains its own conversation context through branches
#    - Essential for Strands Agent Graphs and other parallel agent frameworks
#
# 2. **Context Isolation Improves Agent Performance**
#    - Specialized agents focus on their domain without interference
#    - No context pollution between agents
#    - Cleaner, more relevant conversations
#
# 3. **Shared Session with Isolated Contexts**
#    - Single memory resource and session ID
#    - Multiple branches for different agents
#    - Efficient resource utilization
#
#
# ### Architecture Pattern:
#
# ```
# Memory Resource (memory_id)
#   └── Session (session_id)
#       ├── main branch → Coordinator Agent
#       ├── flight_agent_memory → Flight Agent (can run in parallel)
#       └── hotel_agent_memory → Hotel Agent (can run in parallel)
# ```
#
# AgentCore Memory Branching makes it safe and efficient to build sophisticated multi-agent systems that can scale with your application needs.

# ## Clean up
# Let's delete the memory to clean up the resources used in this notebook.


# client.delete_memory_and_wait(
#        memory_id = memory_id,
#        max_wait = 300,
#        poll_interval =10
# )
