## Tutorials

### 01 - [Runtime](01-AgentCore-runtime/)

Deploy and scale AI agents on a secure, serverless runtime -- regardless of framework, protocol, or model. Covers hosting agents, MCP servers, A2A, and bi-directional streaming. ([Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/agents-tools-runtime.html) · [Deep Dive Video](https://www.youtube.com/live/wizEw5a4gvM?si=7owv5C-kgU8UTzPl))

### 02 - [Gateway](02-AgentCore-gateway/)

Turn APIs, Lambda functions, and existing services into MCP-compatible tools without managing integrations. Includes examples for auth, access control, sensitive data masking, and more. ([Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway.html) · [Deep Dive Video](https://www.youtube.com/live/atWXM5lziY8?si=qKEzTbU1-15B8pQ0))

### 03 - [Identity](03-AgentCore-identity/)

Manage agent identity and access across AWS services and third-party apps (Slack, Zoom) using standard identity providers (Okta, Entra, Cognito). Covers inbound auth, outbound auth, and 3LO flows. ([Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/identity.html) · [Deep Dive Video](https://www.youtube.com/live/wv2doVDF7KQ?si=sxt2lOufwt7cOeUY))

### 04 - [Memory](04-AgentCore-memory/)

Add fully managed memory to your agents for personalized experiences. Explore short-term memory, long-term memory, branching, and security patterns. ([Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/memory.html) · [Deep Dive Video](https://www.youtube.com/live/-N4v6-kJgwA))

### 05 - [Tools](05-AgentCore-tools/)

Use AgentCore's built-in tools: **Code Interpreter** for secure code execution, and **Browser Tool** for web navigation and form completion. ([Code Interpreter Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/code-interpreter-tool.html) · [Browser Tool Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/browser-tool.html) · [Deep Dive Video](https://www.youtube.com/live/z3lAJ-Nf_lk?si=Tf45AR3mZVo9rweL))

### 06 - [Observability](06-AgentCore-observability/)

Trace, debug, and monitor agent performance with OpenTelemetry-compatible telemetry. Works for agents hosted on Runtime, self-hosted agents, Lambda-based agents, and EKS-hosted agents. ([Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/observability.html) · [Deep Dive Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWQgawUPr1k))

### 07 - [Evaluations](07-AgentCore-evaluations/)

Assess agent quality with built-in and custom evaluators across dimensions like correctness, helpfulness, and safety. Includes creating evaluators, running evaluations, and using results. ([Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/evaluations.html) · [Deep Dive Video](https://www.youtube.com/live/i0h7xA8cqYs?si=ZSR_-iQRjju-2H04))

### 08 - [Policy](08-AgentCore-policy/)

Define and enforce security controls using Cedar language policies to prevent data leakage and authority overreach. Covers natural language policy authoring and fine-grained access control. ([Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/policy.html) · [Deep Dive Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_9htaugcgI))

### 09 - [End-to-End Workshop](09-AgentCore-E2E/)

Build a complete agent step by step, combining Runtime, Gateway, Identity, Memory, and more into a production-ready solution. ([Deep Dive Video](https://youtu.be/gI_qvheaSoA?si=Pa6VzGXzopuX_koW&t=490))
