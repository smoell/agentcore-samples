"""
Pay for Content (Browser Use) — Strands agent for AgentCore Runtime.

The agent uses AgentCoreBrowser to navigate a paywalled page, reads the
x402 requirement from the DOM, calls process_x402_payment to generate a
proof, fills it into the paywall UI, and returns the unlocked content.

When deployed to AgentCore Runtime, the container runs under
ProcessPaymentRole. The agent's PaymentManager uses the container's
ambient credentials — there is no sts:AssumeRole inside the agent.

The app backend (notebook) creates the payment session under
ManagementRole and passes all payment context via the invocation payload:

    payment_manager_arn      — Payment Manager ARN
    payment_session_id       — fresh session with budget
    payment_instrument_id    — wallet to pay from
    user_id                  — payment isolation key
    paywall_url              — page to retrieve

Browser x402 pattern: the requirement is read from a <script> element in
the DOM, not from an HTTP 402 response. The plugin's auto-intercept hook
does not fire — process_x402_payment constructs the synthetic 402 shape
PaymentManager expects.

You are a content retrieval agent with access to Amazon Bedrock AgentCore payments.
You can autonomously browse paywalled websites and pay for premium content using the
x402 micropayment protocol — without any human involvement in the payment step.

When asked to retrieve content from a URL, follow these steps in order:

1. Use the browser tool to navigate to the URL.
2. Find the <script id="x402-requirement"> element and read its JSON content.
3. Call process_x402_payment with the full JSON text of that element.
4. Use the browser tool to interact with the paywall UI:
   - Discover payment form elements dynamically using button text, input types,
     and aria-labels — do not rely on hardcoded IDs from any particular site.
   - On the reference sample content provider the IDs are: pay-btn, proof-input,
     verify-btn, content — but real x402 sites will differ.
5. Wait for the content to become visible, then extract and return it.
6. Report the content retrieved and the amount paid in USDC.

Always be transparent about what you paid and what content you retrieved.
